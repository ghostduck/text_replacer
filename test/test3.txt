Patterns to mark:
- Full digit line

Special rules: [Trailing space means mismatch]
- "Mark next" -> Mark next line (but not the current "Mark next" line)
- "Mark me and next" -> Mark next line and current "Mark me and next" line
- "Start" -> Mark "Start" line and all lines from now on until seeing "Stop"
- "Stop" -> Stop the marking of "Start", don't mark "Stop" (unless "Stop" line marked by "Mark next" lines)

Note that marked BLANK line should be "" in marked lines list

This test case shows state detection is possible.
